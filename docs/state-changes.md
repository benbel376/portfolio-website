## Change Log

### 2024 - Dynamic Loader Discovery Implementation

**Date**: Current Session  
**Type**: Enhancement  
**Status**: Completed

**Problem Addressed**:
- Component loader files were not being found due to naming mismatches between directory names and expected loader filenames
- System was too rigid, requiring exact filename patterns like `{componentType}_loader_t1.php`
- Class name assumptions based on directory names were causing failures

**Solution Implemented**:
- Replaced hardcoded filename assumptions with dynamic file discovery
- Added `findLoaderFile()` method that scans directories for any `.php` file containing "loader" in the name
- Added `findLoaderClass()` method that scans PHP file content for any class containing "Loader" in the name
- Applied dynamic discovery to all loader types: components, containers, and sites

**Files Modified**:
- `builders/builder_t1.php`: Updated `loadComponent()`, `loadContainer()`, and `loadSiteBlock()` methods
- `definitions/pages/summary_page_t1.json`: Updated component specifications to use full paths
- `definitions/pages/skills_page_t1.json`: Updated component specifications to use full paths

**Impact**:
- System is now more flexible and robust
- No longer requires specific naming conventions for loader files
- Eliminates need for hardcoded mappings between directory names and class names
- Supports any naming convention as long as files contain "loader" and classes contain "Loader"

**Breaking Changes**:
- Component specifications in page definitions now require full paths (e.g., `"heros/type_1"` instead of `"hero"`)
- Removed `getLoaderClassName()` method from builder
