# System State Changes

This document tracks significant changes and updates made to the portfolio system architecture and implementation.

## Change Log

### 2024 - Dynamic Loader Discovery Implementation

**Date**: Current Session  
**Type**: Enhancement  
**Status**: Completed

**Problem Addressed**:
- Component loader files were not being found due to naming mismatches between directory names and expected loader filenames
- System was too rigid, requiring exact filename patterns like `{componentType}_loader_t1.php`
- Class name assumptions based on directory names were causing failures

**Solution Implemented**:
- Replaced hardcoded filename assumptions with dynamic file discovery
- Added `findLoaderFile()` method that scans directories for any `.php` file containing "loader" in the name
- Added `findLoaderClass()` method that scans PHP file content for any class containing "Loader" in the name
- Applied dynamic discovery to all loader types: components, containers, and sites

**Files Modified**:
- `builders/builder_t1.php`: Updated `loadComponent()`, `loadContainer()`, and `loadSiteBlock()` methods
- `definitions/pages/summary_page_t1.json`: Updated component specifications to use full paths
- `definitions/pages/skills_page_t1.json`: Updated component specifications to use full paths

**Impact**:
- System is now more flexible and robust
- No longer requires specific naming conventions for loader files
- Eliminates need for hardcoded mappings between directory names and class names
- Supports any naming convention as long as files contain "loader" and classes contain "Loader"

**Breaking Changes**:
- Component specifications in page definitions now require full paths (e.g., `"heros/type_1"` instead of `"hero"`)
- Removed `getLoaderClassName()` method from builder

### 2024 - Navigation System Bug Fixes and Improvements

**Date**: Current Session  
**Type**: Bug Fix & Enhancement  
**Status**: Completed

**Problems Addressed**:
1. **Missing Navigation Placeholders**: HTML template had comments but not actual placeholders for PHP loader replacement
2. **Incorrect File References**: Type_2 HTML template was referencing type_1 CSS and JavaScript files
3. **Missing Navigation Functions**: Vertical container navigation functions not loaded in global scope
4. **Theme Toggle Function Missing**: `window.toggleTheme` function not available due to module loading timing issues
5. **Missing Background Images**: 404 errors for background image files

**Solutions Implemented**:

**Navigation Placeholder Fix**:
- Updated `top_bar_site_structure_t2.html` to include proper placeholders:
  - `<!-- NAVIGATION_TABS_PLACEHOLDER -->` for navigation links
  - `<!-- PAGE_CONTENT_PLACEHOLDER -->` for page content
  - `<!-- TITLE_PLACEHOLDER -->` for page title

**File Reference Corrections**:
- Fixed CSS reference: `top_bar_stie_style_main_t1.css` → `top_bar_stie_style_main_t2.css`
- Fixed JavaScript reference: `top_bar_site_behavior_main_t1.js` → `top_bar_site_behavior_main_t2.js`

**Navigation Function Loading**:
- Added global scope exports to `vertical_container_behavior_t1.js`:
  - `window.handleVerticalContainerNavigation`
  - `window.initializeVerticalContainerNavigation`
- Included vertical container script directly in HTML structure
- Added global navigator script to HTML template

**Theme Toggle Fix**:
- Restructured theme function export in `top_bar_site_behavior_theme_t2.js`
- Loaded theme script directly (non-module) to ensure immediate availability
- Added console logging for debugging

**Background Image Handling**:
- User reverted to PNG file references in CSS variables
- Directory structure needs: `blocks/sites/top_bar/images/general/`

**Files Modified**:
- `blocks/sites/top_bar/type_2/top_bar_site_structure_t2.html`: Fixed placeholders and file references
- `blocks/containers/vertical/type_1/vertical_container_behavior_t1.js`: Added global exports
- `blocks/sites/top_bar/type_2/behaviors/top_bar_site_behavior_theme_t2.js`: Fixed function export
- `blocks/sites/top_bar/type_2/top_bar_site_behavior_main_t2.js`: Added vertical container import

**Impact**:
- Navigation links now appear properly in the interface
- Hash-based navigation system fully functional
- Theme toggle button works without errors
- Vertical container state management operational
- All console errors resolved except background image 404s

**Verification**:
- Console shows: "Theme toggle function loaded and exported to window.toggleTheme"
- Console shows: "Global Navigator initialized" and "Discovered X navigation handlers"
- Navigation between "About" and "Skills" tabs functional
- Theme switching operational
